__DEPRECATED:__ As of July 22 2020, Microsoft has closed Mixer.

This is a [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) add-on with live broadcasts from Microsoft's innovative streaming platform, [Mixer](https://mixer.com/).

It is a node.js app written in TypeScript that retrieves stream URLs from Mixer using its REST API and provides them to Stremio. Supports in-memory caching and different levels of logging. Can be configured using environment variables and run in Docker.

- Create an account on https://mixer.com
- Go to the [Dev Lab](https://mixer.com/lab/oauth)
- Accept the Developer Agreement
- Create an OAuth app
